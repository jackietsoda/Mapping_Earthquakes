# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
For this project, I created an earthquake map that had the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and the data on a third map.

## Results
This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables. I created the following:
- 1: Added Tectonic Plate Data
- 2: Added Major Earthquake Data
- 3: Added an Additional Map

On the right side of the map, you have two legends. One shows the magnitude of the earthquake, which is color coordinated and labeled. The other allows you to change the map style to street, satellitte, or dark and also uncheck earthquakes, techtonic plates, or major earthquakes if the user is looking for a more specific finding.
